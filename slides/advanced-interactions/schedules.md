## Pipeline schedules

Pipelines are normally run based on certain conditions being met. For example, when a branch is pushed to repository.
Pipeline schedules can be used to also run pipelines at specific intervals. For example:

  1. Every month on the 22nd for a certain branch.
  2. Once every day.

To schedule a pipeline for project:

  1. Navigate to the projectâ€™s CI / CD > Schedules page.
  2. Click the New schedule button.
  3. Fill in the Schedule a new pipeline form.
  4. Click the Save pipeline schedule button.
